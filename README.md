Hangman

WHAT IS HANGMAN?

Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers.

HOW DOES THE ACTUAL GAME PROCEED?

The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, giving the number of letters, numbers and category. If the guessing player suggests a letter or number which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter or number does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of the hanged man stick figure as a tally mark. The game is over when:

1. The guessing player completes the word, or guesses the whole word correctly
2. The other player completes the diagram

WHAT IS THE DIAGRAM?

This diagram is, in fact, designed to look like a hanging man. Although debates have arisen about the questionable taste of this picture, it is still in use today. A common alternative for teachers is to draw an apple tree with ten apples, erasing or crossing out the apples as the guesses are used up.

HOW IS THE GAME PLAYABLE HERE?

Here, you basically play against the computer. The computer has a pre-designed list of words(29 countries, as of today). The computer displays the number of dashes initially, to inform the player about the number of letters. Then, the user is given 10 lives and he keeps on losing a life after another, as he makes mistakes.

HOW WAS IT DEVELOPED?

This game was developed using Python and using the original game as a reference. I will be working on this more on the days to come. 


THE WORD GAME HANGMAN IS NOW A TEXT BASED CONSOLE GAME :D
